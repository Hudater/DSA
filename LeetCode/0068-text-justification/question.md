## The MaxWidth
You are designing a digital billboard system for a shopping mall. The billboard displays promotional messages in a visually appealing way. Each message needs to be formatted to fit within a specified width so that all lines align neatly. The words in each line must be evenly spaced, and any extra spaces should be distributed as specified.

# Note
* Each message consists of words made up of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
* The maximum number of characters in a line is given as maxWidth .
* Words in a line must be separated by at least one space.
* Extra spaces should be distributed as evenly as possible. If extra spaces cannot be evenly distributed, assign them to the left-most words in the line.
* The last line should be left-aligned, and no extra spaces should be added between words.
* Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth
